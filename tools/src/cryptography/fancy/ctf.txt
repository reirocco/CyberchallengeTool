You need to find the secret key which has been used for the following pair
of plaintext-ciphertext:

Challenge m1 = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Challenge c1 = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Challenge m2 = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Challenge c2 = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

You also know that the secret key is 16 bit long...

Any idea?
