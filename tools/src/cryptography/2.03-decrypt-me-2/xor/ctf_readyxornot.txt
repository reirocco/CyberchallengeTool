The same key has been used to encrypt

challenge_ciphertext = AQYABXAmRTpZCxZSRTMABAEJFw8LRA==
known_ciphertext = AAAAAAACFllUARYAFRwJDAMRFxkYAA==

You know that a XOR cipher has been used: the key is XORed with the plaintext to obtain the ciphertext.

Also, you know that the plaintext for known_ciphertext is
known_plaintext = VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgcGxhaW50ZXh0IQ==

Here's the encryption function:

#Works with ASCII strings with the same length
def encrypt(x,y):

    return ''.join([chr(ord(x[i]) ^ ord(y[i])) for i in range(len(x))]) 


Can you decrypt challenge ciphertext?
