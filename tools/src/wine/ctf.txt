You came across a very strange ciphertext

"SVMWPKMVAIXNZUZXKUWKWPXPVYXKAMNVAYXKAUIKHMIMWUZMHUOMIDXUGXWKAKHKOPKFXVAVHMZKWM"

For sure, this is not encrypted with Caesar!
You also found the .exe that has been used to perform the encryption,
but the password is hardcoded into the application!

Can you decrypt the initial ciphertext?
